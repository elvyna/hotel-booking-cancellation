## Hotel Booking Cancellation

This project is conducted as part of the assessments in INFOSYS 722 Data Mining and Big Data course at The University of Auckland (Semester 2, 2020).
The datasets are retrieved from Antonio et al. (2019), which contain two CSV files of resort and city hotel booking data.

In this project, we aim to 1) identify variables that are associated with cancelled hotel booking, and 2) build a model that can classify whether a booking is likely to be cancelled.

## Repository Structure

- **bdas** directory stores the data mining steps conducted using Big Data Analytics Software stack, where we use PySpark library in Python.
- **osas** directory stores the data mining steps conducted using Open-Source Analytics Software stack. Here, we use Python-based libraries to complete the end-to-end process.
